<h1>Merge algorithm</h1>

<h2>Three-way merge</h2>

<p>
We implement a three-way merge.  When doing a merge, we 
have three sheets:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>local</b> sheet (L).</li>
<li>The <b>remote</b> sheet (R).</li>
<li>The <b>pivot</b> sheet (P), a common ancestor of the local and remote
sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(One can also think of L, R, and P being Left, Right, and Parent).
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
For now, we will only operate on well-formed CSV files.
</p>  

<p>
Sheets should
be in "portrait" format, with data of the same type grouped in
columns, and data referring to the same entity grouped in rows.
</p>

<p>
Sheets should typically have a row or two of header information 
in the first few rows, but this isn't required.  In general,
the "top" of a sheet may have different content than its "body".
</p>

<p>
The treatment of empty values can be tricky.
</p>


<h2>Comparison with text merge</h2>

<p>
Compared with standard three-way text merge, sheets have some
differences.
</p>

<p>
A reordering of lines is no longer a drastic change.
For many sheets, rows may be treated as elements in 
an unordered set.
</p>

<p>
There is a uniform structure to every line in sheets, and 
this structure may get systematically permuted.
</p>


<h2>Representing conflicts</h2>

<p>
Some merges will need human intervention.  It is useful
if a conflicting merge can be represented as a sheet.
The most convenient way to do this is by insertion of 
extra conflict-control rows and columns.  The version control
tool should detect and prevent unresolved conflicts from
being checked in.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a three-way merge where all sheets SL, SR, SP are unrelated.
A "dumb" conflict sheet can be produced as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with an empty sheet.<li>
<li>Insert an empty column C0.</li>
<li>Insert columns Cl for all the columns in SL.</li>
<li>Insert columns Cr for all the columns in SR.</li>
<li>Insert an empty row R0.</li>
<li>Place a special tag T0 in the cell R0,C0.</li>
<li>Place "local" in all cells R0,Cl.</li>
<li>Place "remote" in all cells R0,Cr.</li>
<li>Add rows Rl for all the rows in SL, filling columns Cl only.<li>
<li>Add rows Rr for all the rows in SR, filling columns Cr only.<li>
<li>Place "local" in all cells Rl,C0.</li>
<li>Place "remote" in all cells Rr,C0.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This conflict sheet has the benefit of being reversible (well, there
are issues with treatment of blank values).
The purpose of merging is to reduce redundancy in this sheet,
ideally to the point where the special tag T0 doesn't need to be 
used at all.
</p>

<p>
An example of a full conflict sheet (with T0 set to [conflict]):
</p>

<pre>
LOCAL sheet
-----------
name,  age, location
Paul,   99, Space
Noemi, -10, Imagination

REMOTE sheet
------------
item, cost, qty
frog,   10,  1
bell,    5, 10

CONFLICT sheet
--------------

[conflict], local, local, local,      remote, remote, remote
local,      name,  age,   location
local,      Paul,   99,   Space
local,      Noemi, -10,   Imagination
remote,                               item,    cost,   qty
remote,                               frog,      10,    1
remote,                               bell,       5,   10


</pre>

<p>
Now, in less extreme cases, we should be able to find columns and
rows that we don't need to duplicate, since they either exist
in both (we will label these "share") or can be easily merged
(we will label these "merge").  And if everything is 
shared/merged, we don't need to include the conflict row and
column.
