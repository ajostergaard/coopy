@mainpage Coopy Documentation

The Coopy project contains programs and libraries to help you:

\li Merge CSV files that came from the same source but have been
  modified independently (see \ref ssmerge).
\li Analyze the difference between two or three CSV files
  (see \ref ssdiff).
\li Maintain a repository of CSV files with multiple active contributors
  (see \ref ssfossil and \ref coopy).

Here are some tips on how to use these programs:

\li \ref ssmerge "ssmerge usage".
\if link_examples
\li \ref merge_example.
\endif
\li \ref ssdiff "ssdiff usage".
\if link_examples
\li \ref diff_example.
\endif
\li \ref sspatch "sspatch usage".
\li \ref ssfossil reference.
\li \ref coopy graphical interface reference.
\li \ref patch_format.
\if link_code
\li <a href="annotated.html">Classes</a> used in implementation.
\endif

Code in the Coopy project is all free and open source (licensed under the GPL).
The \ref ssmerge and \ref ssdiff programs currently make use of 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/">libcsv</a>.
The ssfossil program 
is a thin wrapper around <a href='http://www.fossil-scm.org'>fossil</a>.
The \ref coopy program uses <a href='http://www.wxwidgets.org'>wxWidgets</a>.
The experimental (and undocumented) ssinsert program makes use of
the spreadsheet library
within <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a>.
