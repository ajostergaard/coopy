@page table_format Supported table formats

Coopy programs can work with tables represented in the following formats:
 \li CSV (or other delimiter-separated formats).
 \li Sqlite tables.
 \li MySQL tables (partial support at the time of writing).
 \li Spreadsheet sheets, via Gnumeric (.xls, .xlsx, .ods, etc).

CSV support is most complete, followed by Gnumeric, followed by Sqlite,
followed by MySQL.  Good support for all four formats is targeted for
Coopy 1.0.
