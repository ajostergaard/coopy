Coopy version 3

This program uses fossil (the SCM) to make distributed data collection
projects easier.

To build, use CMake (if you have cmake, you can just run ./autogen.sh).

Coopy is licensed under the GPLv2.  See src/coopy_scm/fossil and
src/libmanip2/libcsv for authorship of fossil and libcsv.
